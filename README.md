This is the repository of code during a project in one of my Master's course, Advanced Software Engineering. We choose to work on a sports cards price tracker. Essentially, what we aimed for was to get a platform similar to a stock tracking platform, but for sports cards. 

*Note:* We only consider the PSA 10 Silver Prizm Rookie Card for the sake of time and simplicity.
