***Description:*** This is the repository of code during a project in one of my Master's course, Advanced Software Engineering. We choose to work on a sports cards price tracker. Essentially, what we aimed for was to get a platform similar to a stock tracking platform, but for sports cards. 

***Language:*** Java.

*Note:* 
+ We only consider the PSA 10 Silver Prizm Rookie Card for the sake of time and simplicity.
+ The different Mark versions indicate different versions of codes (the most recent one is the usable ones, all other ones are just there for back-up or reference purposes).
